# Comments on MVC

Controller is additionally layered for dispatching parameters & rendering views with more flexibility and convenience.

Template engineer should be of good use. 

Other things are similar to traditional 3-layer system. 

## WebPOS

The demo shows a simple POS system in MVC architecture, which replaces the shell interface in aw02 with a pos web ui (https://github.com/bshbsh404/simple-pos-ui
).

To run

```shell
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

Currently, it just lists the products for sale with a cart with one item (just for demonstration). 

Please read the tutorial at  https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-crud-thymeleaf and make the POS system robust and fully functional. You can also refer to other articles, for instance https://www.baeldung.com/tag/thymeleaf/ .



And please elaborate your understanding in MVC architecture via this homework in your README.md.
